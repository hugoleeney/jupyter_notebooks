    "# The Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> TEST YOUR INTUITION!! You are a development team lead for a contractor. A new project has come in that you have to cost for your sales team based on hours worked. There are 50 features. Each feature will take 10 hours. The naive estimate is too easy right!? ... WAIT theres more! Each feature will take 100 lines of code and you KNOW that you will have 0.1 bugs per line. Don't panic, you know that each bug will take only 2 hours to fix .. just also consider that every bug will constitute 5 new lines of code and there will be bugs in them too. So, QUESTION: how long before the product is actually pristine? Give your answer in either hours or multiples of the naive estimate."

In our case each bug fix only creates 0.1 * 5 bugs so it does converge. In the table above, after the 9th round of bug fixes less than one whole bug is created so we stop there but the whole sum can be compute by the method given below. \n",
