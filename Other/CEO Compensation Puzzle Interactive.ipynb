    "# The Question\n",
    "\n",
    "    TEST YOUR INTUITION! Imagine ALL the workers in the USA (~200,000,000) worked for one company in a single hierarchy. At the bottom are minimum wage workers earning `$`10/hr. Every 5 minimum wage workers have a superior; every five superiors have their own superior and so on up the hierarchy to the Big Boss CEO (tree of degree 5). Every superior earns 1.3 times the wage of their subordinates i.e. `$`10 -> `$`13 -> `$`16.9 ... QUESTION: what is the hourly and annual wage of the Big Boss CEO??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lets call the earnings multiplier `1.3` above the 'management multiplier'\n",
    "* Lets call the number of workers per supervisor the 'team size'\n",
    "* see below for a diagram of an example hierarchy where team size is 3 and the population of workers is 13\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics of the model outlined above model is not very complicated but I suspect that intuition for what the Big Boss CEO should earn given such simple rules is not good - mine wasn't. This is likely because although the salary does grow exponentially up the hierarchy (like compound interest), the width of the hierarchy shrinks even faster. Below are presented some examples and interactive charts to explore the relationship between the size of teams, 'manager multiplier' and boss multiplier.\n",
