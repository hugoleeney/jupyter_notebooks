    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "First the algorithm starts with the 'first' product-tuple lexicographicall i.e. in crackSafe(3,3) that is '000'. We know that this product-tuple must exist in the sequence in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the next item in the sequence must have some suffix of the last product-tuple we have covered as a prefix. In the best case this is the last n-1 elements (for '000' that is obviously '00') being used as the first n-1 elements of the next. Part of De Bruijn's work was proving that you can always reuse n-1 elements. So for our next product tuple we must decide on some sequence '00*' where `*` is undecided and we have now 2 choices for it (presuming that we don't need to repeat '000').\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm always chooses the highest value for the suffix that hasn't yet been chosen and remembers that choice in the the pres_to_suffs dictionary. In our example that is '2' meaning we choose the product-tuple '002'. The next time the '00' prefix is encountered we will choose '1' meaning we choose the product-tuple '001'. It is sufficient that we always choose items in this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is laid out a longer sequence of choices\n",
    "\n",
    "... start with 000 -> output = '000'\n",
    "next prefix = '00', highest unchosen suffix = 2, output ='0002'\n",
    "next prefix = '02', highest unchosen suffix = 2, output ='00022'\n",
    "next prefix = '22', highest unchosen suffix = 2, output ='000222'\n",
    "next prefix = '22', highest unchosen suffix = 1, output ='0002221'\n",
    "next prefix = '21', highest unchosen suffix = 2, output ='00022212'\n",
    "next prefix = '12', highest unchosen suffix = 2, output ='000222122'\n",
    ".. and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the memory in pres_to_suffs obviously allows us never to repeat a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strict ordering on choices is the next missing piece that allows the De Bruijn sequence to manifest itself. However the starting product-tuple must be chosen carefully. For example, instead of choosing the highest unchosen suffix we could choose the lowest unchosen suffix. This would not work if the first product-tuple was lexicographically the lowest. Specifically we would start with '000' and the resulting sequence would follow. \n",

    "000\n",
    "0001\n",
    "00010\n",

    "00010020\n",
    "000100200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have seen 000, 001 and 002. There are no further unused suffixes for '00' and so we would have to repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correct starting product-tuple for this strict-ordering is the lexicographically highest one i.e. '222'. The code below demostrates."
